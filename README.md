The software must provide the following options to the user: 

to choose who starts the game: user or computer;
to choose which algorithm the computer will use: the Minimax algorithm or the Alpha-Beta algorithm;
to make moves and see changes in the course of the game after the user's moves and the computer's moves;
to start a new game after the current game has been completed.
The software must provide a graphical user interface (command line games will not be accepted). In this case, it is not about a complex, 3D graphical interface but about the use of visual elements such as menus, buttons, text fields, icons, lists, etc. 

When developing software, the student team must implement the following:

generation of a game tree or part of it, depending on the complexity of the game and the computational resources available to the student team;
the development of a heuristic evaluation function;
the implementation of the Minimax algorithm and the Alpha-beta algorithm (both of which can be implemented as N-ply look ahead);
10 experiments with each of the algorithms, recording the number of computer and human victories, the number of nodes visited by the computer in each game, the average time taken by the computer to execute a move.
